  - If the search string is exactly in the returned result it will aways show.
    *Apart from that, the score is determined by how many characters are different.
    *For example, “Movie 1” vs “Movie Vol. 1” will have a score of 95 or so since it is five characters removed.
    *The lower the number, the more results will be displayed to the user (up to the limit of the first page of search results)
